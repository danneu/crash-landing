# crash-landing

The start of an incremental-game prototype built with Elm.

## How to play

You control an escape pod with a single survivor.

The survivor can be suspended in the pod's stasis goo which consumes very few resources, or they can be zapped into consciousness.

The survivor will only make progress on their task (fabrication or research) while they are awake, but consciousness depletes the pod's resources faster.

The pod's weak power grid can only power one subsystem at a given time. You'll have to manually divert the power yourself.  Right now the only two subsystems are life support (+Oxygen per tick) and the matter collector (+Matter per tick).
